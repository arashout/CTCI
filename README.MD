## Princeton Algorithms 2 Interview Problems
- Given a connected graph with no cycles:

1. Diameter: design a linear-time algorithm to find the longest simple path in the graph.
2. Center: design a linear-time algorithm to find a vertex such that its maximum distance from any other vertex is minimized.

- An Euler cycle in a graph is a cycle (not necessarily simple) that uses every edge in the graph exactly one.

1. Show that a connected graph has an Euler cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree.
2. Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a graph has an Euler cycle, and if so, find one.
